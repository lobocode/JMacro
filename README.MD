## JMacro

This is a program that allows you to create macros based on keyboard and mouse. With it, you can remap keys and combine keyboard and mouse actions to be performed with just one or more commands.

## Features

* Remap keys
* Combine keyboard and mouse actions

## Requirements

* Java 8 or higher

## How to use

1. Configure the `config.properties` file with the macro you want to configure

2. Download the jar **[HERE]()** and run it with the following command:

```bash
java -jar jmacro.jar
```

Easy, isn't it? JMacro will be guided by the configuration you made in the `config.properties` file.
